// Registration is what a plugin's New function returns. It is the complete list
// of everything a plugin can hook into, and every field is optional: leave a
// hook nil and Wings never calls it.
//
// Hooks come in two kinds. A gating hook returns a [Decision] and runs before
// Wings does the thing, so it can refuse it. An observing hook returns nothing
// and runs after, so it cannot change the outcome. When several enabled plugins
// hook the same gate, they run in the load order the operator set and the first
// denial wins, so a later plugin cannot override an earlier refusal.
//
// Hooks must return promptly. Wings gives a gating hook a deadline, after which
// it treats the hook as having abstained and logs it, because a plugin that
// hangs must not be able to wedge a power action. Do slow work in a [Job] or a
// goroutine, not in a gate.
type Registration struct {
	// Init runs once when the plugin is enabled, before any other hook. It is
	// the only place a plugin is handed its [Host]. Returning an error marks
	// the plugin errored and leaves it disabled.
	Init func(Host) error

	// Shutdown runs when the plugin is disabled or Wings is stopping. Flush
	// anything you would be sad to lose, then return; Wings does not wait
	// forever.
	Shutdown func() error

	// SettingsChanged runs after an operator saves new settings for the plugin
	// on the Panel. The plugin stays enabled either way, but returning an
	// error is recorded against it so the operator can see the new settings
	// were rejected.
	SettingsChanged func(Settings) error

	// --- power and lifecycle ---

	// BeforePowerAction can refuse a power action. It covers start, stop,
	// restart and kill, so switch on the action. Refusing a kill is allowed
	// but usually wrong: it is the escape hatch an operator reaches for when a
	// server is already stuck.
	BeforePowerAction func(Server, PowerAction) Decision

	// BeforeServerInstall can refuse an install or reinstall, which is the
	// hook to use to hold back a reinstall that would wipe files a plugin
	// cares about.
	BeforeServerInstall func(Server) Decision

	// BeforeServerDelete can refuse deleting a server from the node.
	BeforeServerDelete func(Server) Decision

	// BeforeServerTransfer can refuse a transfer of this server to another
	// node.
	BeforeServerTransfer func(Server) Decision

	// OnServerLifecycle observes everything that happens to a server: created
	// and deleted, install started, completed and failed, state changes,
	// crashes, transfers and finished backups. Switch on [Lifecycle].Event.
	//
	// This is the hook for reacting to a server coming up or going down.
	OnServerLifecycle func(Lifecycle)

	// --- console and commands ---

	// OnConsoleLine sees each line of console output before it reaches the
	// Panel, and can rewrite or drop it. Returning the zero [ConsoleDirective]
	// leaves the line alone.
	//
	// This is a hot path: it runs for every line every server prints. Keep it
	// cheap, and prefer matching on a prefix over compiling a pattern per
	// call. Wings only delivers lines that survived console throttling.
	OnConsoleLine func(ConsoleLine) ConsoleDirective

	// OnCommand sees each console command before it reaches the server process
	// and can rewrite or refuse it. Returning the zero [CommandDirective]
	// lets the command through unchanged.
	OnCommand func(Command) CommandDirective

	// --- files ---

	// BeforeFileAction runs before a filesystem operation a user asked for,
	// and can allow it, refuse it, or carry it out itself. Only user-initiated
	// operations reach it, never the writes Wings performs for its own
	// bookkeeping.
	//
	// Taking the operation over is what [FileHandled] is for, and it is the
	// hook a recycle bin is built on: a plugin moves the file somewhere else
	// and reports the delete as handled, so the user sees their delete succeed
	// while the file still exists.
	BeforeFileAction func(FileEvent) FileDirective

	// OnFileAction observes a filesystem operation after it succeeded.
	OnFileAction func(FileEvent)

	// --- container ---

	// MutateContainer adjusts the container Wings is about to create for a
	// server. It runs on every boot, not only the first, and the patch it
	// returns is merged over what Wings built.
	//
	// Wings reapplies its own security settings after every plugin has had a
	// turn, so a patch cannot weaken container isolation. See [ContainerPatch]
	// for what that rules out.
	MutateContainer func(ContainerSpec) ContainerPatch

	// MutateStartup adjusts the command and environment a server is about to
	// boot with.
	//
	// This runs on every boot, which is the difference that matters between it
	// and MutateContainer: a container is only built once and then reused, so
	// a change made there does not follow a server's configuration, while a
	// change made here applies every time the process starts. It is the hook
	// for adding JVM flags, pinning a variable, or rewriting a startup command
	// the egg cannot express.
	MutateStartup func(Server, Startup) StartupPatch

	// BeforeCrashRestart decides whether Wings restarts a server that stopped
	// unexpectedly. Denying leaves it offline.
	//
	// Wings already declines to restart a server that crashed again too soon,
	// so this is for policy it cannot know: a maintenance window, a server
	// that should page someone instead, or a crash whose logs say restarting
	// will not help.
	BeforeCrashRestart func(CrashInfo) Decision

	// OnStats observes a server's resource usage, sampled on the same interval
	// Wings reports it to the Panel.
	//
	// This fires for every running server for as long as it runs, so it is the
	// second hottest hook after console output. Keep it cheap, and do not call
	// back into the node from it on every sample.
	OnStats func(Server, Stats)

	// BeforeBackup can refuse a backup before any files are read.
	BeforeBackup func(BackupRequest) Decision

	// OnBackupCompleted observes a finished backup, successful or not.
	OnBackupCompleted func(BackupOutcome)

	// OnSftpAuth can refuse an SFTP session after the Panel has accepted the
	// credentials.
	//
	// The Panel has already checked who they are and what they may do, so this
	// is for a policy the Panel has no way to express, such as which addresses
	// may connect. Refusing here fails the login.
	OnSftpAuth func(SftpAuth) Decision

	// OnInstallOutput observes a server's installation script output, line by
	// line, the way OnConsoleLine observes a running server. Unlike console
	// output it cannot be rewritten or dropped: the install log is the record
	// of what the script actually did.
	OnInstallOutput func(InstallLine)

	// Diagnostics contributes a section to the node's diagnostics report, as a
	// set of labelled values.
	//
	// Whatever is returned is included when an administrator collects
	// diagnostics, so put in what someone debugging this plugin would want and
	// nothing they should not see. The report is meant to be shareable, so a
	// plugin must not return credentials here.
	Diagnostics func() map[string]string

	// --- extensions ---

	// ConfigParsers registers egg configuration file formats, keyed by the
	// format name an egg refers to. Registering a name Wings already handles,
	// such as "yaml" or "properties", overrides the built-in for servers on
	// this node, which is occasionally what you want and usually not.
	//
	// A parser receives the file as it is on disk along with the replacements
	// the egg asked for, and returns the rewritten file.

	// Backup registers a backup adapter under a name the Panel can then ask
	// for, alongside the built-in "wings" and "s3".
	Backup *BackupAdapter

	// Routes registers HTTP endpoints. Each is mounted under
	// /api/plugins/<plugin-id>/http, or under
	// /api/servers/<server>/plugins/<plugin-id>/http when server scoped, and
	// inherits the same authentication every other Wings endpoint uses, so the
	// Panel can call them with the node token.
	//
	// A plugin declaring Path "/stats" is therefore reached at
	// /api/plugins/<plugin-id>/http/stats. The "/http" segment keeps plugin
	// routes clear of the management endpoints, so a route named "enable"
	// cannot shadow the one that enables the plugin.
